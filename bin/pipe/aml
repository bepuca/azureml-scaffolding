Execute a pipeline in AzureML

Usage: $0 [options] PIPELINE [-- JOB-XARGS]

Options:
    -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.
    -e, --exp EXPERIMENT  Name or short description of the experiment to run.
                          If provided, execution is tracked in \$EXPERIMENTS_BRANCH
                          with all changes since main in commit with message EXPERIMENT.
                          If not provided, job runs from current branch.
    JOB-XARGS             Additional arguments to pass to the job create command.
                          See "az ml job create --help" for more information.

Arguments:
    PIPELINE  Name of pipeline to execute in AzureML.

The script ensures the PIPELINE is isolated with the minimum necessary files to
run successfully in its own environment. Then, the execution is submitted to
AzureML with a run name matching the one created locally to isolate such files.

If the job is submitted as an experiment - i.e. with the --exp option - a commit
is created with the message EXPERIMENT and all changes since main are tracked
in \$EXPERIMENTS_BRANCH. That commit is accessible from the AzureML job.
