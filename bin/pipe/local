Execute package locally as it would in AzureML

Usage: $0 PACKAGE

Options:
    -h, --help         Show this help message and exit.

Arguments:
  PACKAGE  Directory of the package relative to "$PKGS_PATH".

This script ensures the package is isolated with the minimum artifacts and
is executed locally as it would be in AzureML. The execution is driven by the
usual package entrypoint '__main__.py'. It is the responsibility of the
user to define the entrypoint so it does not require command line arguments but
executes an equivalent payload of what is expected in AzureML.
