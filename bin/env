#!/usr/bin/env bash
#? Export variables from an environment file

function usage {
    cat<<EOF
Export variables from an environment file. This file must be sourced, not executed.

Usage: source $0 FILE

Arguments:
  FILE  Path to the file containing the variables to export.
        Path is relative to the project root directory.

Example:
  source $0 container.env

An environment file is essentially a Bash script that sets variables and all
of which will be automatically exported into the environment of the current
shell. For proper operation, it should only contain variable assignments,
comments and blank lines for formatting. While it is a Bash script, it is
not required to have executable permissions or a shebang line because it will
be sourced.
