Isolate artifacts for an experiment run in a separate directory

Usage: $0 EXPERIMENT RUN_NAME

Options:
    -h, --help            Show this help message and exit

Arguments:
  EXPERIMENT  Directory of the experiment relative to "$CODE_PATH"
  RUN_NAME    Name of the run

The goal is to isolate the absolute minimum to run an experiment. This aims to
make the experiment reproducible and portable as well as easy to reason about in
the future.

The isolated run directory will be created in "$ISOLATED_RUNS/EXPERIMENT/RUN_NAME".
The isolated run directory will contain all files inside EXPERIMENT and will
add the common code and the environment files. Thus, the final structure:
  <run_name>
  ├── .amlignore
  ├── common/
  ├── environment/
  │   ├── Dockerfile
  │   └── requirements.txt
  └── <experiment>
      ├── main.py
      ├── azure-ml-job.yaml
      └── ...

The requirements.txt will contain only the AzureML, common and experiment
dependencies.

If an .amlignore is present in the EXPERIMENT directory, it will be moved one
level up to the isolated run directory so AzureML uses it properly.
