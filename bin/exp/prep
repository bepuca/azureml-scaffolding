Trigger an experiment in Azure ML from a commit in the experiments branch.

Usage: $0 [options] FLOW MESSAGE

Options:
  -h, --help         Show this help message and exit.

Arguments:
    FLOW     Name of the flow to use for the experiment.
    MESSAGE  Subject for the message of the commit to run. Useful to identify
             the experiment associated with the commit.

An experiment is an execution of a flow in Azure ML for the purpose of
validating an hypothesis. For better traceability, we create a commit to
associate with the experiment that contains all the changes, but only the
changes, the current branch has since the last commit in the main branch.

Then, we trigger the flow from this commit in the experiments branch ensuring
a link to it is available in the Azure ML UI.

If submission succeeds, the commit is pushed to the remote experiments branch.
