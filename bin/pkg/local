Execute package locally as it would in AzureML

Usage: $0 PACKAGE

Options:
    -h, --help  Show this help message and exit.

Arguments:
  PACKAGE  Name of the package directory in "\$PKGS_PATH".

This script ensures the package is isolated with the minimum files necessary and
is executed locally as it would be in AzureML. The execution is driven by the
usual package entrypoint '__main__.py'. It is the responsibility of the
user to define the entrypoint so it does not require command line arguments but
executes an equivalent payload of what is expected in AzureML.
