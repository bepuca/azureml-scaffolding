Command:
    test                : Runs pytest inside Docker environment for experiment.
        Run pytest on all tests found inside the experiment folder and inside the common folder.
        Note that for this command to run, you need pytest in your docker image. This is the
        recommended way of testing in this project, as it makes sure the environment matches the
        one the experiment uses everywhere.

Arguments:
    exp [Required] : Name of the experiment for which to run tests; it is defined by the folder
                     name containing the experiment.
    run-xargs      : Extra arguments to be passed to the `docker run` command. It must be a
                     single string.
    test-xargs     : Extra arguments to be passed to pytest. It must be a single string.

Examples:
    Run tests without extra configuration
        make test exp=example_experiment

    Run tests using GPUs and stop after first failure
        make test exp=example_experiment run-xargs="--gpus all" test-xargs="-x"
