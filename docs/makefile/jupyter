Command:
    jupyter             : Spins jupyter lab inside Docker environment for experiment.
        It uses the image created in `build-exp` command for the same experiment. This command
        makes sure all code (and only) for the experiment is available in the same way it is
        when submitted to Azure ML through the `job` command. Additionally, the notebooks folder
        is also mounted. This is the recommended way of working with jupyter in this project, as
        it ensures the environment matches the one the experiment uses everywhere.

Arguments:
    exp [Required] : Name of the experiment for which to spin jupyter; it is defined by the
                     folder name containing the experiment.
    port           : (Default 8888) Port where jupyter runs and is exposed.
    run-xargs      : Extra arguments to be passed to the `docker run` command. It must be a
                     single string.

Examples:
    Spin up the default jupyter lab without any extra configuration
        make jupyter exp=example_experiment

    Spin up jupyter lab exposed in a different port (useful when host machine is already using
    the port, like Azure ML compute instances) and allowing the use of GPUs.
        make jupyter exp=example_experiment port=8890 run-xargs="--gpus all"
