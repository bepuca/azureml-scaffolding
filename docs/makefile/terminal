Command:
    terminal            : Spins interactive terminal inside Docker environment for experiment.
        This command is useful to get a working terminal inside the environment of the experiment
        to investigate things like package installed or folder structure interactively. It
        ensures the files available inside are the same that are available in Azure ML when
        submitting a job.

Arguments:
    exp [Required] : Name of the experiment for which to spin the terminal; it is defined by the
                     folder name containing the experiment.

Examples:
    Spin up a terminal for an experiment
        make terminal exp=example_experiment
