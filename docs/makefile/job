Command:
    job                 : Triggers Azure ML job for experiment.
        This uses (and requires) to have the Azure ML CLI v2 installed. The job specs used are
        the ones defined in `azure-ml-job.yaml` inside the experiment folder. Note that while
        a command job is specified by default, you can use any type of job compatible with
        Azure ML, you just need to change the YAML contents. For more information,
        visit https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/reference-yaml-overview#job

Arguments:
    exp [Required] : Name of the experiment for which to trigger the job; it is defined by the
                     folder name containing the experiment.
    file           : (Default azure-ml-job.yaml) YAML file with the specification of the job.
                     It must be inside the experiment folder. If not at root level of experiment,
                     the full path from the experiment root level has to be passed.
    job-xargs      : Optional extra arguments to be passed to the `az ml job create` call. It
                     should be a single string.

Examples:
    Trigger a job in Azure ML without any extra configuration
        make job exp=example_experiment

    Trigger a job in Azure ML modifying one input using the extra configuration
        make job exp=example_experiment job-xargs="--set inputs.greeting=Welcome"
