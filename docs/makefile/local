Command:
    local               : Executes python file inside Docker environment for experiment.
        It is called `local` referencing that it runs in the host machine where the command is
        called from and not in the cloud. By default, the script ran is `local.py`, which is what
        comes predefined. This command makes sure all code (and only) for the experiment is
        available in the same way it is when submitted to Azure ML through the `job` command.
        This is the recommended way of executing scripts in this project for testing purposes,
        as it makes sure the environment matches the one the experiment uses everywhere.

Arguments:
    exp [Required] : Name of the experiment for which to run script; it is defined by the folder
                     name containing the experiment.
    script         : (Default local.py) Python file to run. It must be inside the experiment
                     folder. If not at root level of experiment, the full path from the experiment
                     root level has to be passed.
    run-xargs      : Extra arguments to be passed to the `docker run` command. It must be a
                     single string.
    script-xargs   : Extra arguments to be passed to the script. It must be a single string.

Examples:
    Run default local.py without extra configuration
        make local exp=example_experiment

    Run custom file that requires an extra input and allow use of GPUs
        make local exp=example_experiment run-xargs="--gpus all" script-xargs="--greeting Welcome"
