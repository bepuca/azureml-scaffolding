Command:
    format              : Format using black & isort. Display flake8 errors.
        Formats code using black & isort and display flake8 errors using the current activated
        environment. It is recommended to have a local python environment with the
        requirements.txt at the root level installed. Note that if you install the pre-commit
        hooks, this formatting will be run anyway when you commit code.
