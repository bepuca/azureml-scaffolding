Command:
    build-exp           : Builds experiment environment Docker image.
        It buils the experiment Docker image as defined by the Dockerfile inside the env folder
        and it tags it as <experiment_name>:latest. The tagging is important because other
        commands that make use of the image expect that naming.

Arguments:
    exp [Required] : Name of the experiment for which to build the image; it is defined by the
                     folder name containing the experiment.
    build-xargs    : Optional extra arguments to be passed to the `docker build` command. It should
                     be a single string.

Examples:
    Build the image for an experiment without any extra configuration
        make build-exp exp=example_experiment

    Build the image for an experiment with some extra configuration. In this case, setting a build
    time argument
        make build-exp exp=example_experiment build-xargs="--build-arg MY_VAR=my_value"
