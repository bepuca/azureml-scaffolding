# To prevent unnecessary files from being included in
# the AzureML code snapshot, make an ignore file (.amlignore).
# Place this file in the Snapshot directory and add the
# filenames to ignore in it. The .amlignore file uses
# the same syntax and patterns as the .gitignore file.
# If no .amlignore file is present, the .gitignore file
# is used to determine which files to ignore.
