# To prevent unnecessary files from being included in
# the snapshot, make an ignore file (.gitignore or .amlignore).
# Place this file in the Snapshot directory and add the
# filenames to ignore in it. The .amlignore file uses
# the same syntax and patterns as the .gitignore file.
# If both files exist, the .amlignore file takes precedence.
